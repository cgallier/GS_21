# Data and code for "The Ratchet Effect in Social Dilemmas"
by Carlo Gallier and Bodo Sturm

# Data and code
There is one R script (GS_21.R) that yields all the tables, tests, regressions, and figures in the paper. Everything relies on data contained in GS_21.csv. 

# Set-up
We used RStudio (Version 1.2.5019). To run the code, download data (GS_21.csv) and code (GS_21.R) and set your working directory accordingly.    

# Figures and tables
All figures are automatically generated and stored in your working directory as .pdf, except Figure 1. Table 2, 3, 5, S3.1, S3.2, S3.3, S3.5 are automatically generated and stored in your working directory as .doc. Table 1, 4, S3.4 are automatically generated and summarized in the console.
